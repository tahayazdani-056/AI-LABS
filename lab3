 Simple ATM Machine
Prompt the user to enter a PIN (e.g., 1234).
If the correct PIN is entered, allow the user to check their balance or withdraw money. Otherwise, print "Incorrect PIN."
Code:
# Define the correct PIN and initial balance
correct_pin = "1234"
balance = 1000  # Example balance

# Prompt the user to enter the PIN
entered_pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")

# Check if the entered PIN is correct
if entered_pin == correct_pin:
    while True:
        # Display menu options
        print("\nATM Menu:")
        print("1. Check Balance")
        print("2. Withdraw Money")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Please select an option (1-3): ")

        if choice == "1":
            print(f"Your balance is: ${balance:.2f}")
        elif choice == "2":
            withdraw_amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            if withdraw_amount <= balance:
                balance -= withdraw_amount
                print(f"Please take your cash: ${withdraw_amount:.2f}")
                print(f"New balance: ${balance:.2f}")
            else:
                print("Insufficient funds.")
        elif choice == "3":
            print("Thank you for using the ATM. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option. Please try again.")
else:
    print("Incorrect PIN.")

Output:
Enter your PIN: 1234
