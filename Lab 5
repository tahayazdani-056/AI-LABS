#1)Print Numbers with Loops: Write a program that uses a loop to print numbers from 1 to
10.
Code:
def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)

print_numbers()

Output:
1
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10

#2)Calculate the Sum of Numbers: Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers
up to a given number using a loop.
Code:
def calculate_sum(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += i
    return total_sum
n = 14  # Change this to any number to find the sum up to that number
print("Sum up to", n, "is:", calculate_sum(n))

Output:
Sum up to 14 is: 105

#3)Display a Star Pattern: Write code using loops and nested loops to create star
pattern(discussed previously)
Code:
def display_star_pattern(rows):
    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        print('*' * i)
rows = 7  # Change this to increase or decrease the number of rows
display_star_pattern(rows)

Output:
*
**    
***   
****  
***** 
******
*******

#4)Find Even Numbers in a List: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and prints
only the even numbers.
Code:
def find_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    print("Even numbers in the list:", even_numbers)

numbers_list = [1, 12, 3, 44, 55, 36, 57, 28, 9, 10, 11, 24, 50, 75, 80, 99]
find_even_numbers(numbers_list)

Output:
Even numbers in the list: [12, 44, 36, 28, 10, 24, 50, 80]
